The implementation is still a bit basic but it generally works pretty well.

## How can I get this?
Builds will be uploaded in the [Releases](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe/releases) section. Please download the APK from the newest release and install it on your device.

## Why isn't this in upstream NewPipe?
[The developer team](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe) behind the official NewPipe decided that they do not want to include this kind of functionality in their app. See https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/pinned/newpipe-and-online-advertising/ and https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3205 for more information and discussion.

We obviously disagree but we respect their decision and continue to offer SponsorBlock in NewPipe via this fork.

## Bugs
Please do not report bugs encountered while using this fork to the upstream developers. Either try to reproduce the bug in vanilla NewPipe and then report it (preferred) or [create a bug report in our repo](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md).
