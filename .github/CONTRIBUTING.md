NewPipe contribution guidelines
===============================

READ THIS GUIDELINES CAREFULLY BEFORE CONTRIBUTING.

## Crash reporting

Do not report crashes in the GitHub issue tracker. NewPipe has an automated crash report system that will ask you to send a report if a crash occures.

## Issue reporting/feature request

* Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/theScrabi/NewPipe/issues) first to make sure your issue/feature hasn't been reported/requested before
* Check if this issue/feature is already fixed/implemented in the repository
* If you are an android/java developer you are always welcome to fix/implement an issue/a feature yourself

## Bugfixing
* If you want to help NewPipe getting bug free, you can send me a mail to tnp@newpipe.schabi.org to let me know that you intent to help, and than register at our [sentry](https://support.schabi.org) setup. 

## Translation

* NewPipe can be translated on [weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/newpipe/strings/)

## Code contribution

* Stick to NewPipe style guidelines (just look the other code and than do it the same way :) )
* Do not bring nonfree software/binary blobs into the project (keep it google free)
* Stick to [f-droid contribution guidelines](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Inclusion_Policy)
* Make changes on a separate branch, not on the master branch (Feature-branching)
* When submitting changes, you agree that your code will be licensed under GPLv3
* Please test (compile and run) your code before you submit changes!!!
* Try to figure out you selves why CI fails, or why a merge request collides
* Please maintain your code after you contributed it.
* Respond yourselves if someone request changes or notifies issues

## Communication
